# EDSP / Extreme Deduction + Scenario Projection

## Core Claim

`EDSP` means:

> `Extreme Deduction + Scenario Projection`
>
> `极限推演 + 场景投影`

Extreme Deduction is the core method. It turns fuzzy continuous ambiguity into a discrete structural coordinate system by pushing key variables to extremes, collapsing possible outcomes, and reading real-world drift.

Short rule:

> 极限推演先建骨架；场景投影只是补充用法。

Scenario Projection remains available as a supplement when a concrete scenario must be placed inside the coordinate system built by Extreme Deduction.

## Mainline / 主路径

### When To Use

Use this skill when facing questions like:

- `A also seems right, B also seems right; which is actually better?`
- `Is this a real binary choice, or is the question malformed?`
- `Should this be decided structurally, or by scenario boundary?`
- `Which option is becoming the natural mainline under current drift?`

Do not use it to replace evidence acquisition, domain research, runtime proof, or stakeholder judgment when those are the actual missing inputs.

### Operating Flow

1. Ask whether the active uncertainty is structural or scenario-specific.
2. If structural, run `Extreme Deduction`:
   - decompose driving variables
   - push variables to extremes
   - collapse outcomes into discrete poles
   - read real-world drift
   - produce positioning or diagnose a malformed proposition
3. Run the `Multi-Role Challenge` inside the same agent before accepting the L1 skeleton:
   - `Builder`: proposes the dimensions, extremes, collapsed outcomes, and drift prior
   - `Challenger`: attacks missed variables, duplicated dimensions, weak extremes, forced collapse, and biased drift reading
   - `Synthesizer`: keeps, rebuilds, or rejects the coordinate system
4. If Extreme Deduction creates a stable coordinate system and a concrete choice remains, run `Scenario Projection`.
5. Output the choice guidance, boundary conditions, and what evidence could overturn it.

## Guardrails / 从属补漏

### Stop Conditions

Stop after Extreme Deduction if the task only needs structural judgment, proposition diagnosis, trend identification, or a finding that the original binary is synthetic.

Run Scenario Projection only when a concrete scenario must be selected inside a stable Extreme Deduction coordinate system.

### Multi-Role Challenge

Use `single-agent multi-role` pressure by default for non-trivial EDSP runs. The
point is not theatrics; it protects L1 from a clean but wrong skeleton.

Boundary: do not run Scenario Projection if `Challenger` finds a missed decisive variable,
duplicated dimension, under-pushed extreme, forced outcome collapse, or biased drift
reading. `Synthesizer` must rebuild L1 or state that EDSP cannot decide yet.

For very high-impact or long-term decisions, separate agents are an escalation option, not the default.

## Boundaries / 边界

- Do not use EDSP to replace evidence acquisition, domain research, runtime proof, or stakeholder judgment.
- Do not run Scenario Projection before Extreme Deduction has produced a stable coordinate system.
- If the output becomes elegant but does not improve a decision, treat the method use as failed.

## Runtime Support / 支撑材料

Read `resources/methodology.md` when you need the detailed EDSP procedure, anti-patterns, or examples of coordinate-system failure.
