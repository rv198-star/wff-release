# Mindthus / 此心

Mindthus is a personal methodology and agent-construction project.

`Thus` means "so / thus / it is so" with a sense of settled judgment. `此心 / Mindthus` means: once this mind has judged the pattern, the work should take that shape.

The name draws from the idea that method is not only an external checklist. It is the crystallization of judgment, evidence boundaries, action posture, and repeated practice.

Short formulation:

> Mindthus turns personal philosophy and methodology into durable `AGENTS.md` instructions and independent `SKILLS` that agents can actually use.

Mindthus can also be installed as a skills pack:

- `mindthus:using-mindthus`
- `mindthus:sela`
- `mindthus:3l5s`
- `mindthus:edsp`
- `mindthus:wae`
- `mindthus:tvg`
- `mindthus:tplan`

## Project Posture

The root agent stance is:

> 遇事不要慌，先搞清楚情况再说。

This means every agent working in this project should prefer situation clarity before conclusion, evidence before confidence, bounded judgment before procedural motion, and executable next steps before decorative structure.

## Organization

Mindthus is organized through two surfaces:

1. `AGENTS.md` defines the project-level agent posture, operating rules, and contribution boundaries.
2. `skills/<skill-name>/` contains independent skills, each with its own `SKILL.md` and optional bundled resources.

Current skills:

- `skills/using-mindthus/` — portable AGENTS-style entry skill for Mindthus posture and routing.
- `skills/sela/` — top-level decision principle: System Efficiency over Local Advantage.
- `skills/3l5s/` — structures vague, complex, or system-level problems through `Three Layers + Five Steps` (`三层五步`): `Discovery / Definition / Resolution` plus `Baseline -> Target -> Gap -> Strategy -> Breakdown`.
- `skills/edsp/` — handles ambiguous qualitative judgments through Extreme Deduction + Scenario Projection.
- `skills/wae/` — separates deterministic workflow control, agentic judgment, and evidence bridging.
- `skills/tvg/` — value-driven thinking-depth enhancer for shallow AI-generated artifacts.
- `skills/tplan/` — Mission-oriented runtime for Task/SubTask/Step state, evidence/log separation, decision hooks, and script-controlled structure changes.

Skill-specific resources live under `skills/*/resources/` so each skill can be used independently. Root-level files should stay limited to project orientation and agent posture.

## Install As A Skills Pack

### Codex

See [.codex/INSTALL.md](/root/mindthus/.codex/INSTALL.md).

Codex supports bundle-style discovery through `~/.agents/skills/`, so the intended namespace is `mindthus` and installation exposes the skills as `mindthus:*`.

Codex also has a system `skill-installer` capability for installing individual skills into `~/.codex/skills`, but that path is not the right fit for this repository's pack-style namespace. Mindthus is intended to be installed as one bundle so the skills remain grouped under `mindthus:*`.

For an existing checkout, install or refresh the Codex skills pack with:

```bash
scripts/install-skills.sh codex --force
```

This creates `~/.agents/skills/mindthus -> <repo>/skills`. Restart Codex after installing.

### Claude Code

Claude Code personal skills live under `~/.claude/skills/`.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rv198-star/Mindthus.git ~/.claude/mindthus
   ```

2. Create the local skills links:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.claude/mindthus
   scripts/install-skills.sh claude --force
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code.

This exposes the same skill set in Claude Code as local skills. Unlike Codex bundle discovery, this path does not currently add a `mindthus:` namespace prefix by itself.

## Verify

Run the repository checks:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_packaging_docs -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/tplan -v
```

For `tplan` only:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/tplan -v
```

The runtime scripts are plain Python and shell scripts. They do not require package
installation inside the repository; installation means exposing the `skills/` directory
to the target agent client.

## Packaging Notes

Mindthus is packaged as a skills directory, not as a Python library. The stable package
surface is:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `skills/*/resources/`
- `skills/*/templates/`
- `skills/*/scripts/` when a skill needs deterministic runtime support

Use `scripts/install-skills.sh` for local symlink installation. If a future client
needs an archive artifact, package the repository by preserving the `skills/`
directory layout exactly; skill paths are part of the runtime contract.

## Skill Rule

Each skill should stay portable and self-contained:

- Put trigger logic and operating procedure in `SKILL.md`.
- Put longer methodology text in `resources/methodology.md`.
- Do not make a skill depend on project-local memory unless the dependency is explicit.
- Do not turn a method into ceremony; preserve the judgment it was meant to protect.
- Do not let scripts, schemas, or templates replace agentic judgment when truth is uncertain.

## Working Rule

When adding or revising a method:

1. Clarify the situation first.
2. Name the bounded method or skill being changed.
3. Preserve the method's philosophical claim.
4. Convert the claim into usable agent behavior.
5. Add evidence, boundaries, and stop conditions.
6. Keep the skill lean enough to load in context.

Mindthus is not a warehouse of notes. It is a forge for reusable judgment.
