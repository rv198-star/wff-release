# tplan Decision Hooks

Decision hooks standardize how `tplan` asks other Mindthus skills for semantic judgment.

Each hook defines:

- `trigger`
- `question`
- `primary_skill`
- `support_skill`
- `required_inputs`
- `expected_output`
- `mutation_rule`

Initial hooks:

| Hook | Trigger | Primary skill | Expected decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mission_intake` | new Mission | `3l5s` | initial Task nodes and acceptance coverage |
| `addition` | new work or missing dependency appears | `3l5s` | whether to add a task and where to attach it |
| `subtraction` | low value, resource pressure, repeated local expansion | `sela` | prune, downgrade, pause, abandon, or continue |
| `chain_role` | low immediate value but possible path dependency | `wae` | evidence-linked chain-role claim with confidence cap |
| `selection` | multiple candidate runtime nodes exist | `sela` | next active node or escalation |
| `loopback` | feedback contradicts current definition | `3l5s` | return to Discovery, Definition, or Resolution |
| `artifact_value_gain` | bounded artifact needs value-gain and TVG value-gain exit check | `tvg` | deepen, return-remediate, block, or freeze |

`artifact_value_gain` is a decision hook, not a Mission Pulse `next_gate`. Pulse routes
observable Mission signals to existing Gates such as `mission_review`, `selection`,
`subtraction`, or `loopback`; a resulting decision packet may then call TVG for bounded
artifact value-gain.

TVG internal outcomes such as `deepen`, `return-remediate`, `block`, and `freeze` are
not `apply_decision` recommendations. Convert any Mission-facing action to the normal
tplan recommendation vocabulary before applying Mission mutations.

Hook output must include recommendation, rationale, confidence, evidence links,
proposed mutations, and requires_human.

## Snapshot / Pulse / Gate Control Surface

TPLAN review control has three layers:

- `Snapshot`: scripts expose runtime state only. Examples: checkpoint, survey,
  validation findings, active task, recent evidence, task logs, and active shared
  risks. Snapshot does not decide semantic truth.
- `Pulse`: a lightweight Mission-level routing note. It asks whether the active path
  can continue locally or should enter an existing Gate. Pulse is not a new judgment
  center and does not mutate Mission state by default.
- `Gate`: existing decision centers such as `continuation_authorization`,
  `anti_spiral_audit`, `selection`, `subtraction`, `loopback`, `mission_review`,
  `risk_assessment`, and `stop_report`.

Short rule:

> Scripts observe. Pulse routes. Gates decide.

`mission_pulse` is optional and route-only. Use it only when a Mission-level review
signal needs routing before another local action. The v0.2 route engine is explicit:

```text
Snapshot -> Candidate Collection -> Candidate Shape Validation -> Gate Arbitration -> Pulse Output -> Gate
```

Snapshot reports observable state. Pulse routes observable signals to an existing Gate.
Gate makes the semantic decision and owns any mutation.

    }

    "next_gate": "mission_review",
    "rationale": "Mission boundary triggers should route to Mission Review before freeze, handoff, or stop.",
    "evidence_links": []
  }
}
```

Candidate Collection reports all observable route candidates before Gate Arbitration
selects one controlling route. Lower-priority candidates remain visible under
`suppressed_candidates` and the selection rationale is exposed through
`arbitration_trace`. Candidate fields include `signal`, `candidate_next_gate`, `scope`,
`source_kind`, `source_ids`, `priority_class`, `severity`, `freshness`, `reason`, and
`context`.

Pulse consumption is a separate runtime action. Use `scripts/consume_pulse.py` when a
Gate or operator has already handled a candidate and later identical pulses should not
keep re-winning by accident. The consumption record is written to Mission state
`pulse_state.consumed_candidates` and mirrored into `evidence.jsonl` as
`event_type=pulse_consumed`. Later identical candidates may surface as
`candidate_state=stale`, while signals that remain active by design still stay active.

Pulse may report observable signals and candidate gates. It must not compute ROI,
classify defects, decide evidence sufficiency, redefine acceptance authority, or
declare the Mission healthy or unhealthy. Pulse is not a new judgment center.
`next_gate=continue` never bypasses high-impact requirements. `next_gate=health_check`
routes to the existing shared-risk/Mission-health judgment surface. Health check is a
route, not a standalone undefined gate.

Use `scripts/mission_pulse.py` for a standalone read-only route note. Use
`survey --pulse --pulse-trigger <trigger>` when the route note should travel with the
ordinary Mission survey; in that wrapper, the full Pulse payload is nested under
`survey["pulse"]`. Both outputs are shape-only inputs for agentic judgment, not gate
decisions. The runtime output also includes Snapshot-side diagnostics that explain what
the route saw: recent evidence summary, active task log summary, evidence-link lint,
review trigger candidates, `winning_candidate`, `suppressed_candidates`,
`arbitration_trace`, and `pulse_shape_findings`.

Do not run Pulse as a fixed full-review ritual after every active task. Trigger it from
events: same-path continuation, freeze or handoff, repeated local touch, weak evidence
delta, user negative feedback, blocker or surprise, active shared risk, active-task
switch candidate, branch cleanup, or a small batch of checkpoints with no acceptance
evidence movement. Low-risk routine checkpoints stay Snapshot-only.

Implemented read-only routes:

- `before_continue` -> `continuation_authorization`
- `before_freeze`, `before_handoff`, or `before_stop` -> `mission_review`
- third touch of the same active-task local object -> `anti_spiral_audit`
- `feedback` trigger with feedback evidence -> `loopback`
- blocker, failure, interruption, or surprise evidence -> `mission_review`
- active shared risk -> `health_check` as the shared-risk/Mission-health route
- `branch_cleanup` or `active_switch_candidate` -> `selection`
- Mission status `requires_human` -> `stop`
- routine `checkpoint_batch` with no trigger candidate -> `continue`
- checkpoint batch without fresh acceptance evidence movement -> `continuation_authorization`

## Anti-Spiral Runtime Gate

`anti_spiral_audit` is a runtime gate, not a standalone Mindthus skill. It exists so a
Mission can activate the Anti-Spiral Self-Audit without relying on the agent to notice
its own loop.

Do not run it on a fixed step-count interval by default. Trigger it when observable
signals show that local repair may be replacing Mission progress:

- the same file, parameter, prompt segment, task node, or local object is touched for
  the third time
- user feedback reports that the result is not good enough, should be tried again, or
  got worse
- the next proposed mutation adds a new function, file, phase, fallback, rule set, or
  special-case branch
- a same-path continuation has weak, unclear, or no expected evidence delta

The gate asks five observable questions:

1. Did the last move add a structural layer?
2. Is this the third or later touch of the same local object?
3. Is the quality signal probabilistic or subjective?
4. Is the next repair aimed at downstream output instead of the upstream cause?
5. If the last move were deleted, would the system lose little or become clearer?

Gate result:

- `green`: zero or one `yes`; continuation is allowed.
- `yellow`: two `yes`; next action must be subtraction or equal replacement.
- `red`: three or more `yes`, or Q3 is `yes`; brake, restate the root problem, return
  to the nearest stable state, and allow only modification of existing structure or
  deletion.

Anti-Spiral evidence should point to step logs, object touch counts, feedback events,
diff summaries, or mechanical checks. Scripts may validate the shape of the audit and
count observable traces. They must not decide whether the root cause is true.

## Linear Continuation Gate

Elapsed time is not the root criterion for stopping or continuing. A long path may be
correct when it is the unique blocker and still has positive marginal Mission ROI. A
short path may already be wasteful when it is one of many options and the next action
will not produce new evidence.

High-impact recommendations must include `path_assessment`. This includes selection,
subtraction, loopback, chain-role, active-task switches, Mission closure, escalation,
and high-impact continuation decisions:

```json
{
  "path_assessment": {
    "marginal_roi": "positive | weak | negative | unclear",
    "path_role": "unique_blocker | dominant_path | one_of_many | unclear",
    "evidence_delta": "new_evidence_expected | weak_evidence_expected | no_new_evidence_expected | unclear"
  }
}
```

Workflow validates only object shape and enum values. Agentic judgment decides whether
the current path really has positive ROI or dominant path status. Evidence links should
constrain confidence; a complete field set is not proof that continuation is correct.

If `marginal_roi` is weak, negative, or unclear, explain why switch, loopback,
subtraction, escalation, or stop is worse before continuing. If `path_role` is
`one_of_many` or `unclear`, compare alternatives. If `evidence_delta` is
`no_new_evidence_expected` or `unclear`, do not call the next action verification unless
it can produce decision-constraining evidence.

When weak evidence delta combines with repeated local edits or additive layering,
route through `anti_spiral_audit` before authorizing same-path continuation.

### Continuation Authorization

Mission-facing same-path `continue` decisions require `continuation_authorization`.
This keeps same-path continuation inside the Linear Continuation Gate instead of adding
separate pressure-case-specific lint, generation, rerun, or defect-queue workflows.

```json
{
  "continuation_authorization": {
    "trigger_reasons": ["repeated_same_path_attempt"],
    "evidence_shape_lint": "pass | fail | not_applicable | unclear",
    "defect_classification": "none | acceptance_blocking | batchable_detail | unclear",
    "expected_evidence_delta": "new_evidence_expected | weak_evidence_expected | no_new_evidence_expected | unclear",
    "authorized_action": "continue_same_path | targeted_fix | batch_details | mission_review | anti_spiral_audit | stop"
  }
}
```

count-based reminders are triggers, not decisions. A third touch, repeated same-path
attempt, post-continuation defect, repeated negative feedback, high-cost or
high-blast-radius continuation, or weak evidence delta only routes the decision into
this gate. It does not automatically stop the Mission or authorize continuation.

Evidence-shape lint is shape-only evidence. Scripts may flag placeholder anchors,
sample evidence, empty anchors, template residue, or evidence links not bound to real
artifacts. Scripts must not decide whether human review is substantively credible or
whether release readiness is semantically true.

## Shared Risk Context Gate

Shared Risk Context carries Mission-level risk signals that can change risk-adjusted
value assessment for later decisions. It is deliberately not cross-task log sharing:
execution units do not read each other's task logs. A unit publishes a scoped signal
when a blocker, degraded shared condition, invalid evidence risk, abnormal cost, or
recovery result can affect other units.

Risk context is recorded through `risk_context_update` and `risk_context_recovery`
evidence events, with live state in `mission.shared_context.risk_signals`.

Mission Shared Context Memory is loaded before hooks through Mission identity preflight.
The project-level file is `.tplan/shared_contexts/tplan_mission_shared_context-<mission_id>.md`.
Use `preflight_mission.py` to distinguish `continue_existing`, `create_new`, and
`needs_agentic_selection` before runtime initialization. `source_contexts` may inform a
new Mission, but they do not create a derived Mission status or transfer acceptance
authority.

When a high-impact hook output is produced while active shared risks exist, include:

```json
{
  "risk_assessment": {
    "shared_context_used": ["R1"],
    "invalid_evidence_risk": "low | medium | high | unclear",
    "failure_risk": "low | medium | high | unclear",
    "risk_adjusted_value": "positive | weak | negative | unclear",
    "next_gate": "continue | health_check | switch | stop | escalate"
  }
}
```

Workflow validates only object shape and enum values. Agentic judgment decides whether
the shared signal applies to the active decision, how much it changes risk-adjusted
value, and whether the next gate is continuation, health check, switch, stop, or
escalation.

If a decision ignores active shared risks, its rationale should explain why the risk is
out of scope, or set `risk_adjusted_value` to `unclear`.

## Alignment And Mission Review Gates

Adaptive runtime levels reduce packet frequency, not risk sensitivity. In any runtime
level, high-impact changes still require alignment or review before mutation.

Ordinary SubTask and Step hooks are parent-relative. Before a hook output can justify
an ordinary child mutation, it must state:

- `parent_alignment`: how the recommendation advances the parent node.
- `mission_trace`: the lightweight path from child -> parent -> Mission evidence.

Use three decision handling levels:

- `inline alignment`: ordinary Step/SubTask choices with a short `parent_alignment`
  note and lightweight `mission_trace`.
- `light packet`: subpath switch, blocker, repeated failed attempt, or meaningful
  uncertainty that may affect the parent node.
- `full mission review`: high-impact Mission-facing choices that can materially affect
  convergence or authority.

High-impact hooks remain Mission-relative. Use `mission_alignment` when the decision
materially affects Mission convergence. The `full mission review` path uses the full
gate:

- `mission_review.objective_alignment`: how the decision relates to the current Mission
  objective.
- `mission_review.acceptance_gap`: which acceptance evidence is satisfied, still
  missing, protected, or intentionally deferred.
- `mission_review.task_contribution`: how the affected task contributes to Mission
  convergence.
- `mission_review.roi_effect`: one of `advance`, `protect`, `reduce_waste`,
  `defer_uncertain`, or `escalate`.
- `mission_review.non_action_risk`: what Mission risk increases if the decision is not
  taken.

High-impact decisions include adding or removing success-critical tasks, changing the
active task, closing the Mission, making subtraction decisions after resource pressure
changes, looping back because the problem definition is challenged, or expanding the
same supporting/exploratory branch more than once.

Scripts may validate hook output shape. They must not validate semantic correctness.
